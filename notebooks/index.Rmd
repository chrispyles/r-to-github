### About

This repository is a skeleton for a reproducible R pipeline that allows you to create and publish analyses online hosted through Github Pages. It works by knitting the Rmd files in the `notebooks` directory into the `export` directory to create a static HTML site which can be hosted from the repository containing the original work. This is nice because it reduces the number of repositories related to a single project and allows you to keep all of your work in one place.

### How To Use It

To use this pipeline, there are a few simple steps.

1. Copy the contents of this repo locally. Do not edit any of the files in the `utils` directory.
2. Put any analysis notebooks in the `notebooks` directory. The naming scheme begins with a 0-padded number to indicate ordering and then using the `-` character in place of spaces. For example, if the fifth notebook was titled "Principal Component Analaysis with Scree Plot", then the filename would be `05-principal-component-analysis-with-scree-plot.Rmd`. The utilities function will automatically capitalize all words in the title.
3. Create a homepage for your project. This will be an Rmd file that should be saved as `notebooks/index.Rmd`.
4. Run the file `utils/export.R`. This will generate the necessary JavaScript files for the page menus and knit each Rmd file in the `notebooks` directory. All output HTML files should appear in the `export` directory.
5. Push to Github and you're done!

### Notes

These are some things I've noticed that make the output look nicer when using this workflow.

* Start with level 3 headings rather than level 1 headings, because otherwise the page title and the headings look the same.
